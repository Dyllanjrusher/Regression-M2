# Regression-Metis Project 2

## This repository contains the bulk of my Linear Regression project for Metis. This project was on building a web scraper to scrape college data and then use that data to predict median income 10 years after graduation. 

### The Notebooks folder contains all of my jupyter notebooks, which contain function calls for data scraping, data cleaning, EDA, and finally model selection and model visualization.

### The functions folder contains web scraping functions as well as prepprocessing and model selection functions.
